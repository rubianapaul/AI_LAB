# 8 puzzle problem with A* approach

### Heuristic function used is number of misplaced tiles in current state compared to target


# 1. Number of misplaced tiles

### Can convert to class and have an arr with 
# positions represented as 1s or 0s so we can just add to get this function

def H_n(state, target):
    # Number of misplaced tiles is the Heuristic function
    return sum(x != y for x, y in zip(state, target))            # sum of all 'True's if x != y
    
    ### Equivalent code
    # s = [] 
    # for i in range(state): # 0-8
    #     if state[i] != target[i]:
    #         s.append(1)
         
    # return sum(s)






# 2. F(n) => function used to decide which node to select next
def F_n(state_with_lvl):
    state, lvl = state_with_lvl
    return H_n(state, target) + lvl # H_n(n) + G_n(n) #
